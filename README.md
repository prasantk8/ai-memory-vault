# AI Memory Vault – MVP User Stories

This document outlines a set of **user stories** for the initial MVP of the AI Memory Vault. Each story follows the classic _“As a <role>, I want <feature> so that <benefit>”_ format. The goal is to provide clear requirements that can be tracked and iterated upon in a project management tool (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira, Trello).

## 1. Overview

The **AI Memory Vault** aims to provide users with a unique experience of organizing, exploring, and reliving their digital memories. Below are the MVP-level user stories, ensuring we cover:

- Basic **media import** from device or cloud storage.  
- **AI-based tagging** to categorize and index media.  
- Simple **narrative generation** for short text summaries of events or albums.  
- A **conversational search** interface for memory queries.  
- Core **privacy & security** measures (encryption at rest, user-owned data).  
- A **user-friendly interface** that conveys warmth and emotional engagement.

These stories will evolve with input from user testing, engineering constraints, and design feedback. All changes will be tracked in a versioned manner in our Git repository.

## 2. Epics & User Stories

### 2.1 Media Import

**Epic Goal**: Allow users to seamlessly bring their photos and videos into the AI Memory Vault from their devices and one external cloud service.

#### US-001: Import Media from Device
- **Story**:  
  _“As a smartphone user, I want to easily import my photos and videos from my phone’s gallery so that I can begin organizing and tagging them in the AI Memory Vault.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. User sees a permission prompt to access the phone’s gallery.  
  2. User can select specific albums or choose a bulk import option.  
  3. The imported media appears in the vault’s timeline view within one minute (assuming a normal internet connection).  
  4. Import progress is displayed to the user (e.g., a progress bar or spinner).

#### US-002: Connect to External Cloud Storage (e.g., Google Drive)
- **Story**:  
  _“As a user with cloud-stored photos, I want to link my Google Drive account so that I can import selected images into the AI Memory Vault without manual downloads.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. User can authorize Google Drive via OAuth.  
  2. Selected folders or images from Google Drive can be added to the vault.  
  3. A sync status confirms when media have been successfully imported or if any errors occurred.  
  4. The system handles duplicates gracefully (e.g., no repeated copies of the same image).

### 2.2 AI Tagging & Indexing

**Epic Goal**: Automatically categorize media using AI, making them easily searchable and groupable by event, people, or sentiment.

#### US-003: Basic Object Recognition
- **Story**:  
  _“As a user, I want my photos automatically tagged by objects or scenes (e.g., beach, city, mountains) so that I can quickly filter and find relevant pictures.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. Each new photo triggers an AI tagging process in the background.  
  2. Tags (e.g., “beach,” “car,” “portrait”) are stored as metadata.  
  3. User can see these tags in a photo details screen and in the search filter.  
  4. Users can edit or remove tags if inaccurate.

#### US-004: Sentiment or Emotion Tagging
- **Story**:  
  _“As a user, I want my photos analyzed for the general sentiment (smiling faces = happy, etc.) so that I can discover particularly joyful or special memories more easily.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. AI identifies obvious emotional cues (e.g., smiles for “happy,” crying for “sad”).  
  2. The system surfaces a “happiness” or “excitement” tag for relevant images.  
  3. The user can filter their gallery by emotional tone (e.g., “show me my happiest photos”).

### 2.3 Narrative Generation

**Epic Goal**: Provide short text summaries or highlight reels for a selected album or event, emphasizing emotional and contextual details.

#### US-005: Generate Text Summary for an Album
- **Story**:  
  _“As a user, I want to generate a quick story or summary for an album (e.g., ‘My Weekend Trip’) so that I can instantly share or remember the essence of that event.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. User selects an album of up to 15 images.  
  2. The system analyzes the event (location data, object tags, timestamps) and produces a short paragraph summary.  
  3. Summary includes a suggested event title (e.g., “Beach Getaway”).  
  4. User can modify or regenerate the summary if it’s not accurate or appealing.

#### US-006: Basic Sharing of Generated Text
- **Story**:  
  _“As a user, I want the option to copy or share the AI-generated summary so that I can quickly send it to friends or post it on social media.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. A ‘Share Summary’ button appears after generation.  
  2. Tapping it opens native share dialogues (mobile) or a link for easy copy/paste (web).  
  3. The text references the album/event name and includes a short custom link if the user wants to share photos publicly (optional).

### 2.4 Conversational Search

**Epic Goal**: Enable users to interact with their vault in a conversational style, retrieving photos or events through natural language queries.

#### US-007: Text-Based Conversational Interface
- **Story**:  
  _“As a user, I want to type a query in natural language (‘Show me photos from my trip to London 2022’) so that I can quickly find the relevant memories.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. A chat-style or search bar interface is visible from the main screen.  
  2. The system returns relevant photos, grouped or listed with short text responses.  
  3. User can refine the search if needed (e.g., “Only the ones at night.”).  
  4. The response time is under 3 seconds for typical queries.

#### US-008: Basic Follow-Up Queries
- **Story**:  
  _“As a user, after seeing my initial search results, I want to refine my search with a follow-up query (‘Only show the ones with Anna smiling’) so that I don’t need to start a new search from scratch.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. The system maintains conversation context for at least one or two follow-up questions.  
  2. The user sees updated results or is prompted if the system can’t handle deeper context.  
  3. The chat log clearly indicates the new filtered results.

### 2.5 Privacy & Security

**Epic Goal**: Ensure user data is secure at rest and in transit, with clear options to mark content private.

#### US-009: Encryption at Rest
- **Story**:  
  _“As a security-focused user, I want my photos to be encrypted on the server so that my personal data can’t be accessed by unauthorized parties.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. All media files are stored using strong encryption (AES-256 or similar).  
  2. Metadata is stored in a secure database with restricted permissions.  
  3. Documentation: The system’s privacy policy explains how encryption keys are managed.

#### US-010: Private vs. Shareable Media
- **Story**:  
  _“As a user, I want to mark certain albums or photos as private so that only I can view them, while others are shareable with a custom link.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. Default setting is private.  
  2. User can toggle an album or photo to “shareable.”  
  3. A short unique link is generated if ‘shareable’ is selected. Anyone with the link can view, but cannot modify.

### 2.6 Core UI & UX

**Epic Goal**: Provide an intuitive, pleasant experience that emphasizes emotional resonance, ease of use, and a clean flow.

#### US-011: Onboarding & Permissions
- **Story**:  
  _“As a first-time user, I want a quick, friendly tutorial that explains how to import photos, generate stories, and search so that I can get started without confusion.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. A 3-step splash screen or carousel.  
  2. Clear calls-to-action to grant gallery permission and (optionally) connect cloud storage.  
  3. Skippable but easily re-accessible tutorial from settings.

#### US-012: Main Timeline View
- **Story**:  
  _“As a user, I want to see my photos in a timeline format, grouped by date or event, so that it’s straightforward to scroll through my library.”_
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  1. Timeline groups by date/event.  
  2. Thumbnails load quickly with an infinite scroll mechanism or pagination.  
  3. Tapping a thumbnail opens a detailed view with tags, short summary (if generated), and any share options.

## 3. Workflow & Iteration Example

We will store each user story in our Git repository as separate issues (or one `.md` file per epic) and track tasks across sprints. For instance:

1. **Create a GitHub Issue** for _US-001: Import Media from Device_.  
2. **Link or reference** design mockups, acceptance criteria, and any relevant architectural discussions.  
3. **Assign** the issue to engineering owners.  
4. **Use labels** like `frontend`, `backend`, `AI`, `design-needed` for clarity.  
5. **Discuss** implementation details in the comments.  
6. **Close** the issue once all acceptance criteria and QA checks are passed.

This approach ensures everything is traceable and version-controlled.

## 4. Recommended Tools

- **GitHub Projects/Issues**: Ideal for small to medium teams already using GitHub.  
- **Jira**: More robust for larger organizations needing deeper sprint planning and reporting.  
- **Trello**: Simple Kanban boards for a quick, visual workflow.  
- **Asana**: Another project management platform with good team collaboration features.  

**For Iterations**:  
- We can automatically generate tasks from `.md` files via scripts or GitHub Actions.  
- Integrate continuous integration (CI) pipelines to ensure code quality and run unit tests for each story branch.
